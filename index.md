The AEBC2 has been established in 2016. Its workshop is intended as a yearly meeting of European bioinformatics **core facilities**, covering all aspects **scientific** and **operative**.

## Next AEBC2 Event

This year our workshop will be happening at [Personalized Health Technologies 2024](https://personalizedhealth.ch) on 26<sup>th</sup> of August in Zurich, Switzerland.

## Call for Abstracts

Submit **your abstract** for a contributed talk by sending e-mail to <info@aebc2.eu> by 30th of June 2024. 

Abstract towards contributed talks within the scope of the workshop goals are welcome. Selection will be done by the AEBC2 organization committee.  

### Registration 

> Registration for PHT 2024 will open soon.

AEBC2 will be available as a workshop for all participants of PHT 2024 at an additional fee of CHF 40, including coffee breaks and lunch.

## Program 

The keynote presentation will be given by [Martin Fergie, PhD](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/martin.fergie) of the University of Manchester. He is a machine learning and computer vision researcher in the Division of Informatics, Imaging and Data Sciences. His research interests are focussed on using machine learning models to predict disease outcomes from medical imaging data. Key projects include: predicting breast cancer risk from screening mammograms; predicting clinical outcomes for cancer using multiplex immunofluorescence tissue imaging.

## Scope

As part of the PHT 2024 conference and by nature of our AEBC2 host [NEXUS](https://www.nexus.ethz.ch) the scientific scope of the workshop will be on human health, medicine, and clinical research. Please note that as always also other topics are possible, especially on the operative/administrative side of bioinformatics core facilities.

A more prose description can be found on the [PHT 2024 website](https://www.personalizedhealth.ch/info/AEBC2).

### Goals

- Cultivating a community of bioinformaticians engaged in clinical service provision, including tool and service developers.

- Assessing the strengths and weaknesses of current technologies.

- Sharing outcomes from benchmark studies and systematic data/tool quality assessments.

- Harmonizing study designs for quality assessments.

- Disseminating best practices in bioinformatics for clinical applications, focusing on effective communication with clinicians.

- Developing robust protocols for reporting clinical evidence.
