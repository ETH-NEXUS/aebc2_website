# AEBC2 Workshop


The AEBC2 workshop has been established as a yearly meeting of European bioinformatics **core facilities**, covering all **scientific** and **service aspects**. 

## 6th AEBC2 Event 2022 

The sixth edition of the **AEBC2** workshop will take place at the **ECCB** conference on Sunday, September 18th, 2022 in Sitges, Barcelona, Spain. It will be an **in-person** event - we look forward to meeting you! Each year, there is a different focus topic; for 2022 we selected **Mass Spectrometry and Multi-Omics Bioinformatics**

Registration and **call for abstracts** has started! 

### Call for Abstracts

## Goals & Scope

The number of bioinformatics core units in industrial and academic research environments is growing rapidly. The AEBC2 workshop provides an exchange opportunity for scientific and service aspects of bioinformatics core facilities in Europe.

This year the event is focusing on Mass Spectrometry and Multi-Omics Bioinformatics. 

The general goals of the workshop are:
- fostering a community of bioinformaticians working in providing services, including researchers and companies producing tools for or services to them;
- understanding the strengths and weaknesses of available technologies;
- exchanging results of benchmark studies, of systematic data and tool quality assessment efforts;
- learning about best practices: what to do and what to avoid in bioinformatics when offered as a service, especially to clinician;
- developing best practices of reporting evidence to clinicians.

We address publicly used analysis infrastructures, bioinformatics services and research, as well as translational bioinformatics issues like integration of bio-banking, medical information (records) and the corresponding genomic information. The topics discussed include, but are not limited to, ideas, new solutions and best practices in : 

- High throughput data processing, data analysis and interpretation
- Reproducible research, workflow and tool management
- Benchmarking of data analysis workflows
- Data management, data sharing, data security, and legal aspects
- Next-generation infrastructure, e.g. virtualization, cloud services, etc

We address publicly used analysis infrastructures, bioinformatics service and research, as well as translational bioinformatics issues like integration of bio-banking, medical records, and the corresponding genomic information.
