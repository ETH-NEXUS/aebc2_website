# 5th AEBC2 Workshop

The fifth edition of the AEBC2 workshop will take place as a stand-alone workshop on October 15, 2021. It will be an in-person event. Sessions will be recorded and made available after the workshop on this website.

## Topics

The 2021 workshop is focussing on three topics:

- **National Bioinformatics Initiatives - how can core facilities fit into the picture?**
- **Single cells beyond molecular**
- **Healthy cohorts**

We have the pleasure to announce formidable keynote speakers:

# Scope

The number of bioinformatics core units in industrial and academic research environments is growing rapidly. The AEBC2 workshop provides an exchange opportunity for scientific and service aspects of bioinformatics core facilities in Europe.

The increasing need for bioinformatics translated to clinical application as a service marks one of the challenges core facilities face today. Examples include omics-informed precision oncology, rare genetic diseases, infectious diseases, and preventive medicine. Due to embarking into new fields and the topic fast evolving, there is much uncertainty about standards, best practices, and continuous tool development, which leads to much duplication happening. This workshop aims to bring together leading researchers and practitioners in these areas to exchange latest approaches, experiences, benchmark results, protocols and best practice guidelines. The workshop format will include invited and contributed talks selected from an open call for contributions, panel discussion on national bioinformatics initiatives and time for networking. See also the programme.

We address publicly used analysis infrastructures, bioinformatics service and research, as well as translational bioinformatics issues like integration of bio-banking, medical records, and the corresponding genomic information.

# Goals

- fostering a community of bioinformaticians working in providing services, including researchers and companies producing tools for or services to them;
- understanding the strengths and weaknesses of available technologies;
- exchanging results of benchmark studies, of systematic data and tool quality assessment efforts;
- learning about best practices: what to do and what to avoid in bioinformatics when offered as a service, especially to clinician;
- developing best practices of reporting evidence to clinicians.
